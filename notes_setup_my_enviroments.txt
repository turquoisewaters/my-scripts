Setting up my enviroment within a CMD window:

Navigate/set proper directories
	Often times when we open a CMD window it will open into a werid directory that we don't like
	and we need to navigate to our project directory or to a directory that we perfer.
	cd to the directory that we prefer
	Tell cmd which directory to open in 

	put a script into the default location cmd starts up in.
	change the "start in" value from the properties window. I could not figure this out in Windows7

	@echo off
	rem This file is to be located in the default directory of CMD.exe
	rem running this script changes directory to my-utilities or what I'm calling my "home"
	cd %HOMEPATH%\my-utlities


Setup the enviromental variables and ...
Setup paths for programs that I want execute from CMD line setup_paths.bat
setup_env.bat



	@echo off
	rem Batch file to be located into the default directory of when CMD.exe is started
	set mhome=%HOMEPATH%\Desktop
	set mdocs=%HOMEPATH%\Documents
	set mbin=%HOMEPATH%\my-utlities\bin
	set mu=%mhome%\my-utilities
	set mp=%mhome%\my-projects
	set mn=%mhome%\my-notes
	cd %mhome%

	echo "Setup the path to work with stand alone programs"

	echo "Setup the path to portable git"
	set gitpath="C:\Users\admin\Desktop\my-utilities\PortableGit-2.29.2.3-64-bit"
	set PATH=%gitpath%\cmd;%PATH%

	rem set HOME="C:\C:\Users\admin\Desktop\my-utilities"
	rem git --cd-to-home


	echo "Set path for vim"
	set vimpath="C:\Users\admin\Desktop\my-utilities\Vim\vim80"
	set PATH=%vimpath%;%PATH%


	echo "Set path for sublime text"
	set sublimepath="C:\Users\admin\Desktop\my-utilities\Sublime Text Build 3143 x64"
	set PATH=%sublimepath%;%PATH%


	echo "Set path for VS Code
	set vscode="C:\Users\admin\Desktop\my-utilities\VSCode-win32-x64-1.46.1"
	set PATH=%vscode%;%PATH%


bad part about using env variables is that you have to type extra %% and $ ($variable$, $variable) char to use them
would a bat file be better ... then we could just type "mu" to go straight to

Start Programs: start_programs.bat
	@echo off
	rem Batch file to start a few programs that I always use.
	start "outlook" "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\office15\outlook.exe"
	start "excel" "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\office15\EXCEL.exe" %mn%\bash_and_cmd_line_commands.xlsx
	start "my-utilities" %windir%\explorer.exe %mu%
	start "my-projects" %windir%\explorer.exe %mp%
	start %mu%\"Sublime Text Build 3143 x64\sublime_text.exe" %mn%\my-lists.txt

I found the documentation for portable git to be very helpful.
Read this again and again and again and again and again.
The info and concepts here can be applied to other programs 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to start using PortableGit
------------------------------

If you are comfortable with a Unix-like shell, just launch 'git-bash.exe'.

If not, just launch 'git-cmd.exe'.

Alternatively, you can execute these commands to modify the %path%
variable temporarily:

        set gitdir=c:\portablegit
        set path=%gitdir%\cmd;%path%

Adjust the 'gitdir' according to your setup.  As long as you do not
close the command window, you can now simply type "git" or "gitk" to
really call "c:\portablegit\cmd\git.exe" or "c:\portablegit\cmd\gitk.exe".

By default, git-cmd and git-bash use the directory they were started from as
the working directory when run. You can override this by passing --cd-to-home
to them, which will set the user's home directory as the working directory (as
if Git for Windows was installed).

In addition, if you set the HOME environment variable (either permanently or
for the current session only) you can make Git store and  use the configuration
files in the directory specified in that variable. And if you specify
--cd-to-home, git-bash and git-cmd will use that as the working directory when
launched, too. For example:

        set HOME=%cd%/home
        git --cd-to-home
will use the relative directory named home (%cd% specifies the current
directory).

Quick start
-----------

Start configuring git with your personal settings:
        git config --global user.name "Joe Sixpack"
        git config --global user.email joe.sixpack@g_mail.com

Start using git:
        git --help


How to change %path% permanently
--------------------------------

You may also want to make the modification to the %path% variable a
permanent one. The %path% variable may be changed:

* either on a System level (for all users in the lower pane), if you are
  an Administrator
* or for your own user account only (in the upper pane).

To change the %path% variable permanently:

* right-click "My Computer",
* select "Properties",
* open "Advanced",
* click "Environment Variables",
* highlight the "Path" variable,
* click "Edit" (either in upper or in lower pane),
* add your specific path to front of "Variable value" field, separated
  by a semicolon from the existing entry.

Any naming conventions followed consistently will always help. Here are a few helpful tips for shell variable naming:

    Use all caps and underscores for exported variables and constants, especially when they are shared across multiple scripts or processes. Use a common prefix whenever applicable so that related variables stand out and won't clash with Bash internal variables which are all upper case.

    Examples:
        Exported variables with a common prefix: JOB_HOME JOB_LOG JOB_TEMP JOB_RUN_CONTROL
        Constants: LOG_DEBUG LOG_INFO LOG_ERROR STATUS_OK STATUS_ERROR STATUS_WARNING

    Use "snake case" (all lowercase and underscores) for all variables that are scoped to a single script or a block.

    Examples: input_file first_value max_amount num_errors

    Use mixed case when local variable has some relationship with an environment variable, like: old_IFS old_HOME

    Use a leading underscore for "private" variables and functions. This is especially relevant if you ever write a shell library where functions within a library file or across files need to share variables, without ever clashing with anything that might be similarly named in the main code.

    Examples: _debug _debug_level _current_log_file

    Avoid camel case. This will minimize the bugs caused by case typos. Remember, shell variables are case sensitive.

    Examples: inputArray thisLooksBAD, numRecordsProcessed, veryInconsistent_style
